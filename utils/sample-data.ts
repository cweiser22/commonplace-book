# Excerpt from *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Page 14

>It was always right in front of me. The fear was there in the extravagant boys in my neighborhood, in their large rings and medallions, their big puffy coats and their full-length fur-collared leathers, which was their armor against the world. They would stand on the corner of Gwynn Oak and Liberty, or Cold Spring and Park Heights, or outside the Mondawmin Mall, with their hands dipped in Russel sweats. I think back on those boys now and all I see is fear, and all I see is them girding themselves against the ghost of the bad old days when the Mississippi mob gathered ‘round their grandfathers so that the branches of the black body might be torched, then cut away. The fear lived on in their practiced bop, their slouching denim, their big t-shirts, the calculated angle of their baseball caps, a catalog of behaviors and garments enlisted to inspire the belief that these boys were in firm possession of everything they desired.

## What I Noticed
- the author recounts a childhood story with adult perspective
- the teenagers’ clothing is described with grandeur
- the author avoids commas between adjectives making the text feel faster-paced 
- the grandeur of these teenagers is juxtaposed with their vulnerability
- the relaxed clothing and confident behavior is in contrast with constant fear
- Coates conjures the stereotype of a black teenager as confident, aggressive, extravagantly dressed, but subverts this stereotype by analyzing the fear that these boys were trying to cope with in their behavior and expression

## Making Meaning from Evidence
One of the most stereotyped groups of people is young, black men. Media depictions often paint the image of a confident, aggressive black teenager in streetwear who acts tough and doesn’t have a care in the world. This stereotype has had a huge impact on the way in which society sees black teenagers and has been the source of unfounded racial fears. In *Between the World and Me*, Coates subverts this stereotype while revisiting a childhood anecdote. He describes the extravagantly-dressed young black men in his neighborhood which he viewed as powerful when he was a young child. But in revisiting his memory of these men, he dissects how the facade of power and confidence these men exhibited was a method of coping with the intense fear and vulnerability they faced every day as black men. Coates argues that the aggressive behavior that black teenagers are often stereotyped as exhibiting is a form of trying to take back power, a way to feel ownership of their bodies in spite of oppression. He examines how they’ve carried the fear that their grandfathers felt in the days of lynching. The juxtaposition of relaxed clothing and fear is how Coates demonstrates his awareness of the stereotype and his response to it.
What’s particularly powerful about this passage is that the reader rethinks their subconscious expectations of which they may not have been aware before reading this passage. The reader is now primed to question their inherent biases and preconceived notions about African Americans. After reading this passage, the reader now realizes that these teenagers are not aggressive or mean, but scared and vulnerable.

## Placing Meaning in Context
An important aspect of my analysis is that it helped understand the black experience from the inside perspective rather than outside. I felt a much stronger understanding of African-American culture after breaking down this passage, which made me realize how much of black culture is the result of having to cope with constant fear and degradation. Analyzing the full text in depth reveals the purpose of this book to give the reader an understanding of the individual black experience. Coates further delves into this point in the next page, discussing the relation between body ownership and the etiquette of street brawls. I think the main point of what Coates is trying to say is “This is how it feels,”.

# Excerpt from Teju Cole's "The Black Lives Matter Superhero Photographs"
>The movies are not the most subtle world cinema has to offer, but superheroes are a cultural force. They fill a psychological need in a world of drift and inchoate war. They have also, along the way, become powerful elements in any contemporary sense of visuality.
The relationship between superhero movies and the photographs from Black Lives Matter is not a matter of photographers trying to make protesters look like superheroes. It is that when such photographs emerge from the countless thousands taken at rallies and similar events, they are immediately recognized by a crowd already sensitized to their formal qualities.

## What I Noticed
- makes me think about the rise of superhero popularity and how it relates to current world affairs
- I had never really thought about why clean-cut good vs. evil stories are so popular
- it is interesting how people search out familiarity in nonfiction media

## Making Meaning from Evidence
This passage from Teju Cole’s article dissects the human need to bridge the gap between familiar media and real-life. The image of a superhero standing alone against some great evil is recognized by almost all Americans, and tends to focus on the might of a superhero’s powers or strength. However, the Black Lives Matter Superhero Photograph depicts a hero whose bravery comes from calmness and courage, not might. This subverts the common association between power and physical might and allows the viewer to reconsider what power means.
Another interesting subversion of reader expectations is that the heroic figure in this photograph is a black woman. The majority of popular superheroes are white males, which subconsciously breeds the association between whiteness, masculinity, and bravery. Black women are extremely underrepresented in this genre, so it grabs the reader’s attention to see a black, female superhero figure.

## Placing Meaning in Context
I think there are two connected main arguments in this article. The first is the connection between the superhero genre and the power conflicts in real-life. People feel an inherent need to familiarize the complicated issues in the world, and one of the ways in which they do that is by drawing connections to the media. A detail Cole mentioned that was very fascinating to me was the correlation between ongoing armed conflicts and superhero movies. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were confusing and unclear to many Americans, so they turned to superhero movies with a clean-cut line between good and evil and an obvious purpose to fight.
The second point into which Cole delves is the representation of black women in the media. A superhero is what most obviously comes to mind when one is thinking of a symbol of good in fiction. The fact that these figures are predominantly white males reinforces racism by creating positive connotations related to whiteness and reinforces sexism by playing into the idea that society is not comfortable with powerful women. These images are a great counter to the underrepresentation of black women which also remind us of the reality of the ongoing civil rights struggle.

# Andrea Long Chu and Inclusive Activism

## The Reality of Social Movements

_On Liking Women_ by Andrea Chu initially engaged me with the author’s account of her adolescence. After divulging her teenage confusion and disappointments, she shifted her focus to radical femenist movements, detailing the history of transphobia within radical femenist movements. Though I’ve always supported femenist causes, I never knew about the complex debate within the movement surrounding transgender legitemacy. Chu makes a point (which is admittedly minor in the context of the story, it just caught my interest) how almost all popular movements, though they tend to inflict positive change, end up being a mixed bag, citing examples such as the Occupy movement. I began to think about the ongoing activism during this election season and wonder: who are we excluding from our activism?

## Feeling Excluded from a Movement

The first thought that came to mind was of my local community and my culture. I hail from the progressively liberal but mostly Jewish community of Calabasas. Specifically, I thought about one of my close friends who, while an avid progressive activist who wasn’t afraid of tear gas, felt that antisemitism was conspicuously absent from the progressive radar. I’ve unfortunately noticed a new trend of Republicans attempting to sway Jewish voters by flinging questionable allegations of antisemitism at Democratic politicians. It is definitely unsettling to see that the only concerns about antisemitism seem to be insincere political ploys used to counter other causes.
Chu explains similar feelings of exclusion. Early radical femenist movements were openly transphobic, and she felt intimidated by the idea that she wasn’t “hip” enough for feminism. After recounting some particularly controversial writings by radical feminists, she laments the unfortunate fact that transgender women still feel their feminimity is in question.

# The Intimacy of a Letter, An Analysis of the Medium of James Baldwin's _My Dungeon Shook_

> I have begun this letter five times and torn it up five times. I keep seeing your face, which is also the face of your father and my brother. I have known both of you all your lives and have carried your daddy in my arms and on my shoulders, kissed him and spanked him and watched him learn to walk. I don't know if you have known anybody from that far back, if you have loved anybody that long, first as an infant, then as a child, then as a man. You gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort.

The most stunning thing about My Dungeon Shook is that after the first sentence, you completely forget you are reading a published, rhetorical piece. Immediately, the article tosses out the possibility of coming across as an edited, polished opinion piece or essay, and instead feels almost voyeuristic, like the reader is butting into a slice of Baldwin’s personal life.
One of the most challenging aspects in any form of writing is evoking authenticity and genuinity. Readers have an acute sense for detecting phoniness, a sense which is amplified when consuming texts of such divisive topics such as race relations. Balwin, however, completely evades any semblance of fakeness with his intimate letter format. An article addressed to the general public comes with the implication that the author does not know the personal reader, and is reaching out to them as a sort of an opinion salesman, someone whose only main goal is to sway beliefs with little concern for the individuality of the reader. But rather than speaking as a pundit, Baldwin takes on the persona of the reader’s Uncle, along with the authenticity and emotion that comes with familial relationships. The tone is not only intimate, but disarming. No attempt to argue with the reader or put down any group of people is made. It is simply a passionate letter to a family member.
Perhaps the most emotionally disarming aspect of this letter is Balwin’s urging of his nephew not to harbor any hate towards the white oppressors, and instead attempt to empathize and show compassion towards those who hate him. Overall, this letter has an air of personal warmth that could not be acquired with any other format.

const entryFive = `# Glorida Anzaldua: Language as a Part of One's Identity

> Chicano Spanish sprang out of the Chicanos' need to identify ourselves as a distinct people. We needed a language with which we could communicate with ourselves, a secret language. For some of us, language is a homeland closer than the Southwestfor many Chicanos today live in the Midwest and the East.

## Language As An Absolute

As school children, most of us learn about language and grammar in terms of absolute truths, standards from which any deviation was “wrong”. It’s “am not” as opposed to “ain’t”, it’s “grey” not “gray”, that letter is silent, that letter is not silent, you need this here and that over there. Language was not art, not a form of expression or an exercise of individuality, it was more like math, where there was correct and there was incorrect, proper and improper.

## How Speech Conveys Identity

Anzaldua argues that language is not simply a set of standards and absolutes, but a crucial aspect of one’s expression. She opens the text with a jarring, almost violent narrative of a dentist becoming angry as a patient’s tongue interferes with an operation, asserting that something must be done about this tongue’s rebellious nature. The symbolism of this passage implies that stripping someone of their freedom of expression is a form of violence. This opening is intended to make the reader uncomfortable by using an angry dentist to convey the narrative, as many readers may have had terrifying experiences with dentists as a kid. The intensity of the imagery further conveys a horror-movie-like atmosphere.

She follows with an account of childhood experiences in which she was disciplined in school and at home for speaking with a Chicano accent. She was forced to attend a special speech class, the sole purpose of which was to make her accent more Anglo-American. To Anzaldua, language represents an attachment to nationality, a form of connection to her heritage that nobody had the right to take away. As she reflects on these experiences, she points out the inhumanity of censoring an accent, and further divulges the value of language to Chicanos who live in the United States. Overall, the reader begins to question their previous understanding of the concept of language, and how the idea of a “correct” language is arbitrary and wrong.

const entrySix = `# Momo Pixel's _Hair Nah_: My In-Game Thoughts And Reflection

## A Few Thoughts That Came Into My Head While Playing

- Cool art
- Let's go
- This isn't so hard
- Oops let one slip
- Ah shoot a lot just slipped
- Why is my trackpad so sloppy
- Okay level two is a bit intense
- This is HARD!!!
- WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING PERMISSION IF YOU’RE GONNA TOUCH IT ANYWAY

## _Hair Nah_ Wants You To Feel Frustrated, Tired and Creeped Out

Momo Pixel’s Hair Nah is an interesting experience. Your avatar is a black woman with natural hair, and your goal is to travel while still protecting your personal space. A barrage of hands leaps toward your hair, which you must deflect before the time runs out. The controls feel a bit awkward, which is an aspect of the game that feels intentional. The type of high precision, fast mouse movements were incredibly difficult on my laptop trackpad, which was a constant source of frustration throughout the game, an emotion I think Momo Pixel wants me to feel. Women of color have to feel this pressure at all times, and experiencing it for a few minutes is an eye opener. The voice effects added throughout the game play do a good job of making me feel creeped out. A steady flow of “Can I touch your hair?”, “Is it attached to your head?” and other short phrases soon become tiresome and repetitive. This game brought the discomfort to life in a way that is simply amazing.

const entrySeven = `# Comparing Taming a Wild Tongue and Mother Tongue

These two texts analyze the concept of language, and the discrepancy between their idea of language and what society deems correct. An idea central to both texts is that there is no true “correct” way to speak, and the existence of “proper” English is just a social construct. They describe examples of being belittled as a result their accents or linguistic differences, as well explain the importance of language in maintaining their cultural identity. Tan even subtly nods to her affection for her mother’s accent by describing it as “impeccable broken English”.

_Taming a Wild Tongue_ is stylistically a more intense work. It draws on rather gruesome imagery, and describes accounts of much more violent childhood memories, which included being hit for speaking with an accent. Mother Tongue uses more mundane examples, with Tan describing how her mom had her speak on the phone to sound more professional or how a language barrier affected her performance academically. Anzaldua describes how she was forced to take a class in school which had the sole purpose of destroying her accent. Tan, on the other hand, describes being academically marginalized, stating that her accent gave teachers the false impression that English isn't her “strong suit”, and is instead deemed a “math kid”. However, through her own exploration of passion, she learned that she indeed had a talent for writing.

Overall, both are interesting pieces documenting the struggle of immigrants to maintain their national identities. The perspectives elucidated in each article have been valuable to helping me think of language in an entirely different way.
