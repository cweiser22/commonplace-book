# Excerpt from *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Page 14

>It was always right in front of me. The fear was there in the extravagant boys in my neighborhood, in their large rings and medallions, their big puffy coats and their full-length fur-collared leathers, which was their armor against the world. They would stand on the corner of Gwynn Oak and Liberty, or Cold Spring and Park Heights, or outside the Mondawmin Mall, with their hands dipped in Russel sweats. I think back on those boys now and all I see is fear, and all I see is them girding themselves against the ghost of the bad old days when the Mississippi mob gathered ‘round their grandfathers so that the branches of the black body might be torched, then cut away. The fear lived on in their practiced bop, their slouching denim, their big t-shirts, the calculated angle of their baseball caps, a catalog of behaviors and garments enlisted to inspire the belief that these boys were in firm possession of everything they desired.

## What I Noticed
- the author recounts a childhood story with adult perspective
- the teenagers’ clothing is described with grandeur
- the author avoids commas between adjectives making the text feel faster-paced 
- the grandeur of these teenagers is juxtaposed with their vulnerability
- the relaxed clothing and confident behavior is in contrast with constant fear
- Coates conjures the stereotype of a black teenager as confident, aggressive, extravagantly dressed, but subverts this stereotype by analyzing the fear that these boys were trying to cope with in their behavior and expression

## Making Meaning from Evidence
One of the most stereotyped groups of people is young, black men. Media depictions often paint the image of a confident, aggressive black teenager in streetwear who acts tough and doesn’t have a care in the world. This stereotype has had a huge impact on the way in which society sees black teenagers and has been the source of unfounded racial fears. In *Between the World and Me*, Coates subverts this stereotype while revisiting a childhood anecdote. He describes the extravagantly-dressed young black men in his neighborhood which he viewed as powerful when he was a young child. But in revisiting his memory of these men, he dissects how the facade of power and confidence these men exhibited was a method of coping with the intense fear and vulnerability they faced every day as black men. Coates argues that the aggressive behavior that black teenagers are often stereotyped as exhibiting is a form of trying to take back power, a way to feel ownership of their bodies in spite of oppression. He examines how they’ve carried the fear that their grandfathers felt in the days of lynching. The juxtaposition of relaxed clothing and fear is how Coates demonstrates his awareness of the stereotype and his response to it.
What’s particularly powerful about this passage is that the reader rethinks their subconscious expectations of which they may not have been aware before reading this passage. The reader is now primed to question their inherent biases and preconceived notions about African Americans. After reading this passage, the reader now realizes that these teenagers are not aggressive or mean, but scared and vulnerable.

## Placing Meaning in Context
An important aspect of my analysis is that it helped understand the black experience from the inside perspective rather than outside. I felt a much stronger understanding of African-American culture after breaking down this passage, which made me realize how much of black culture is the result of having to cope with constant fear and degradation. Analyzing the full text in depth reveals the purpose of this book to give the reader an understanding of the individual black experience. Coates further delves into this point in the next page, discussing the relation between body ownership and the etiquette of street brawls. I think the main point of what Coates is trying to say is “This is how it feels,”.

# Excerpt from Teju Cole's "The Black Lives Matter Superhero Photographs"
>The movies are not the most subtle world cinema has to offer, but superheroes are a cultural force. They fill a psychological need in a world of drift and inchoate war. They have also, along the way, become powerful elements in any contemporary sense of visuality.
The relationship between superhero movies and the photographs from Black Lives Matter is not a matter of photographers trying to make protesters look like superheroes. It is that when such photographs emerge from the countless thousands taken at rallies and similar events, they are immediately recognized by a crowd already sensitized to their formal qualities.

## What I Noticed
- makes me think about the rise of superhero popularity and how it relates to current world affairs
- I had never really thought about why clean-cut good vs. evil stories are so popular
- it is interesting how people search out familiarity in nonfiction media

## Making Meaning from Evidence
This passage from Teju Cole’s article dissects the human need to bridge the gap between familiar media and real-life. The image of a superhero standing alone against some great evil is recognized by almost all Americans, and tends to focus on the might of a superhero’s powers or strength. However, the Black Lives Matter Superhero Photograph depicts a hero whose bravery comes from calmness and courage, not might. This subverts the common association between power and physical might and allows the viewer to reconsider what power means.
Another interesting subversion of reader expectations is that the heroic figure in this photograph is a black woman. The majority of popular superheroes are white males, which subconsciously breeds the association between whiteness, masculinity, and bravery. Black women are extremely underrepresented in this genre, so it grabs the reader’s attention to see a black, female superhero figure.

## Placing Meaning in Context
I think there are two connected main arguments in this article. The first is the connection between the superhero genre and the power conflicts in real-life. People feel an inherent need to familiarize the complicated issues in the world, and one of the ways in which they do that is by drawing connections to the media. A detail Cole mentioned that was very fascinating to me was the correlation between ongoing armed conflicts and superhero movies. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were confusing and unclear to many Americans, so they turned to superhero movies with a clean-cut line between good and evil and an obvious purpose to fight.
The second point into which Cole delves is the representation of black women in the media. A superhero is what most obviously comes to mind when one is thinking of a symbol of good in fiction. The fact that these figures are predominantly white males reinforces racism by creating positive connotations related to whiteness and reinforces sexism by playing into the idea that society is not comfortable with powerful women. These images are a great counter to the underrepresentation of black women which also remind us of the reality of the ongoing civil rights struggle.

# Andrea Long Chu and Inclusive Activism

## The Reality of Social Movements

_On Liking Women_ by Andrea Chu initially engaged me with the author’s account of her adolescence. After divulging her teenage confusion and disappointments, she shifted her focus to radical femenist movements, detailing the history of transphobia within radical femenist movements. Though I’ve always supported femenist causes, I never knew about the complex debate within the movement surrounding transgender legitemacy. Chu makes a point (which is admittedly minor in the context of the story, it just caught my interest) how almost all popular movements, though they tend to inflict positive change, end up being a mixed bag, citing examples such as the Occupy movement. I began to think about the ongoing activism during this election season and wonder: who are we excluding from our activism?

## Feeling Excluded from a Movement

The first thought that came to mind was of my local community and my culture. I hail from the progressively liberal but mostly Jewish community of Calabasas. Specifically, I thought about one of my close friends who, while an avid progressive activist who wasn’t afraid of tear gas, felt that antisemitism was conspicuously absent from the progressive radar. I’ve unfortunately noticed a new trend of Republicans attempting to sway Jewish voters by flinging questionable allegations of antisemitism at Democratic politicians. It is definitely unsettling to see that the only concerns about antisemitism seem to be insincere political ploys used to counter other causes.
Chu explains similar feelings of exclusion. Early radical femenist movements were openly transphobic, and she felt intimidated by the idea that she wasn’t “hip” enough for feminism. After recounting some particularly controversial writings by radical feminists, she laments the unfortunate fact that transgender women still feel their feminimity is in question.

# The Intimacy of a Letter, An Analysis of the Medium of James Baldwin's _My Dungeon Shook_

> I have begun this letter five times and torn it up five times. I keep seeing your face, which is also the face of your father and my brother. I have known both of you all your lives and have carried your daddy in my arms and on my shoulders, kissed him and spanked him and watched him learn to walk. I don't know if you have known anybody from that far back, if you have loved anybody that long, first as an infant, then as a child, then as a man. You gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort.

The most stunning thing about My Dungeon Shook is that after the first sentence, you completely forget you are reading a published, rhetorical piece. Immediately, the article tosses out the possibility of coming across as an edited, polished opinion piece or essay, and instead feels almost voyeuristic, like the reader is butting into a slice of Baldwin’s personal life.
One of the most challenging aspects in any form of writing is evoking authenticity and genuinity. Readers have an acute sense for detecting phoniness, a sense which is amplified when consuming texts of such divisive topics such as race relations. Balwin, however, completely evades any semblance of fakeness with his intimate letter format. An article addressed to the general public comes with the implication that the author does not know the personal reader, and is reaching out to them as a sort of an opinion salesman, someone whose only main goal is to sway beliefs with little concern for the individuality of the reader. But rather than speaking as a pundit, Baldwin takes on the persona of the reader’s Uncle, along with the authenticity and emotion that comes with familial relationships. The tone is not only intimate, but disarming. No attempt to argue with the reader or put down any group of people is made. It is simply a passionate letter to a family member.
Perhaps the most emotionally disarming aspect of this letter is Balwin’s urging of his nephew not to harbor any hate towards the white oppressors, and instead attempt to empathize and show compassion towards those who hate him. Overall, this letter has an air of personal warmth that could not be acquired with any other format.

const entryFive = `# Glorida Anzaldua: Language as a Part of One's Identity

> Chicano Spanish sprang out of the Chicanos' need to identify ourselves as a distinct people. We needed a language with which we could communicate with ourselves, a secret language. For some of us, language is a homeland closer than the Southwestfor many Chicanos today live in the Midwest and the East.

## Language As An Absolute

As school children, most of us learn about language and grammar in terms of absolute truths, standards from which any deviation was “wrong”. It’s “am not” as opposed to “ain’t”, it’s “grey” not “gray”, that letter is silent, that letter is not silent, you need this here and that over there. Language was not art, not a form of expression or an exercise of individuality, it was more like math, where there was correct and there was incorrect, proper and improper.

## How Speech Conveys Identity

Anzaldua argues that language is not simply a set of standards and absolutes, but a crucial aspect of one’s expression. She opens the text with a jarring, almost violent narrative of a dentist becoming angry as a patient’s tongue interferes with an operation, asserting that something must be done about this tongue’s rebellious nature. The symbolism of this passage implies that stripping someone of their freedom of expression is a form of violence. This opening is intended to make the reader uncomfortable by using an angry dentist to convey the narrative, as many readers may have had terrifying experiences with dentists as a kid. The intensity of the imagery further conveys a horror-movie-like atmosphere.

She follows with an account of childhood experiences in which she was disciplined in school and at home for speaking with a Chicano accent. She was forced to attend a special speech class, the sole purpose of which was to make her accent more Anglo-American. To Anzaldua, language represents an attachment to nationality, a form of connection to her heritage that nobody had the right to take away. As she reflects on these experiences, she points out the inhumanity of censoring an accent, and further divulges the value of language to Chicanos who live in the United States. Overall, the reader begins to question their previous understanding of the concept of language, and how the idea of a “correct” language is arbitrary and wrong.

const entrySix = `# Momo Pixel's _Hair Nah_: My In-Game Thoughts And Reflection

## A Few Thoughts That Came Into My Head While Playing

- Cool art
- Let's go
- This isn't so hard
- Oops let one slip
- Ah shoot a lot just slipped
- Why is my trackpad so sloppy
- Okay level two is a bit intense
- This is HARD!!!
- WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING PERMISSION IF YOU’RE GONNA TOUCH IT ANYWAY

## _Hair Nah_ Wants You To Feel Frustrated, Tired and Creeped Out

Momo Pixel’s Hair Nah is an interesting experience. Your avatar is a black woman with natural hair, and your goal is to travel while still protecting your personal space. A barrage of hands leaps toward your hair, which you must deflect before the time runs out. The controls feel a bit awkward, which is an aspect of the game that feels intentional. The type of high precision, fast mouse movements were incredibly difficult on my laptop trackpad, which was a constant source of frustration throughout the game, an emotion I think Momo Pixel wants me to feel. Women of color have to feel this pressure at all times, and experiencing it for a few minutes is an eye opener. The voice effects added throughout the game play do a good job of making me feel creeped out. A steady flow of “Can I touch your hair?”, “Is it attached to your head?” and other short phrases soon become tiresome and repetitive. This game brought the discomfort to life in a way that is simply amazing.
`;

const entrySeven = `# Comparing Taming a Wild Tongue and Mother Tongue

These two texts analyze the concept of language, and the discrepancy between their idea of language and what society deems correct. An idea central to both texts is that there is no true “correct” way to speak, and the existence of “proper” English is just a social construct. They describe examples of being belittled as a result their accents or linguistic differences, as well explain the importance of language in maintaining their cultural identity. Tan even subtly nods to her affection for her mother’s accent by describing it as “impeccable broken English”.

_Taming a Wild Tongue_ is stylistically a more intense work. It draws on rather gruesome imagery, and describes accounts of much more violent childhood memories, which included being hit for speaking with an accent. Mother Tongue uses more mundane examples, with Tan describing how her mom had her speak on the phone to sound more professional or how a language barrier affected her performance academically. Anzaldua describes how she was forced to take a class in school which had the sole purpose of destroying her accent. Tan, on the other hand, describes being academically marginalized, stating that her accent gave teachers the false impression that English isn't her “strong suit”, and is instead deemed a “math kid”. However, through her own exploration of passion, she learned that she indeed had a talent for writing.

Overall, both are interesting pieces documenting the struggle of immigrants to maintain their national identities. The perspectives elucidated in each article have been valuable to helping me think of language in an entirely different way.
`;

const entryEight = `# The Shallowness of Blaming Immigrant Parents

The impossible choice my father had to make was an interesting piece that voiced the perspective of an immigrant child who illegally immigrated to the United States with her parents. The article was a response to comments made by First Lady Melania Trump, who claimed that parents of undocumented immigrants were ultimately responible for the hardships faced in immigration detention and family separation. The Trump administration’s family separation policy received intense criticism for violating the rights of immigrants and causing severe emotional distress. Blaming the parents of undocumented immigrants for this hardship is a way for the Trump administration to deny responsibility for actions commited ultimately by the federal government.

Reyna Grande, an immigrant author who faced the hardships of illegal immigration, took insult from this perspective. Grande revisits her memories as a child in Mexico, when her parents had immigrated without her to the United States to work as a result of economic devastation in Mexico. When she finally sees her father again at age 10, she begs him to take her with him across the border. She knew the trip was dangerous, but to her, it was worth it. She chose to take the risk, a decision she would never want to go back on.

Stories like those of Reyna Grande reveal the shallowness of viewpoints such as the First Lady’s. We must not condemn the parents of immigrants who were forced to make the impossible choice of leaving their children behind, or risking their safety to provide them a better future in the United States. I understand now why Grande feels that the response of the Trump administration is callous, and completely detached from reality.

const entryNine = `# Reflecting on My Summer Writing

> This is a stark contrast to most of my literature assignments in high school. Most of my teachers emphasized simply two things: memorizing the material and interpreting the author’s point of view. A question on an assignment would often look like “What caused Achilles to desert the Greek army in this chapter?” or “What is Shakespeare mainly analyzing in Hamlet’s soliloquy?”.

Now that some time has passed since this course has begun, I felt like revisiting some of my earlier writings, so I’m using the next few entries to review a few old works from this class. The first assignment I did for this class was a free write about how I hope to change the way in which I engaged with text. After reading How to Mark A Book, I expressed excitement with the idea of metaphorically engaging in conversation with the author rather than a passive absorption of ideas. I definitely read far more provocative texts in this class than in high school, and it was nice to really break down a short yet insightful article.

I think the best example of a “close-read” I can recall was my reading of Chu’s _On Liking Women_, a text that analyzes the author’s trangender identity in relation to feminism. The text was initially confusing, an opinion I was not alone in. My breakout room was a bit shaky when discussing the article in class, prompting me to revisit it with a bit more depth. I started to really get into Chu’s head, and absorbed her meaning in the idea of “eating the cake and being it too”. The freedom to interpret in this class definitely helped me get more personal with text, absorbing it not for the grade but for myself.

const entryTen = `# Looking Back on My First Entry

> An important aspect of my analysis is that it helped understand the black experience from the inside perspective rather than outside. I felt a much stronger understanding of African-American culture after breaking down this passage, which made me realize how much of black culture is the result of having to cope with constant fear and degradation.

My first Commonplace Book entry was a reflection on Chapter 1 of _Between the World and Me_ by Ta-Nehisi Coates. I chose to analyze a passage in Coates’s book that really spoke to me about how a lot of black culture was simply a coping mechanism to deal with the constant fear and degradation of being black in America. This passage opened me up to the idea of using reading as a way to vicariously experience another person’s life, a way to connect not just with the facts of their life but with the feelings, sights, smells and thoughts. After reading the book, I think that it indeed one of Coates’s main intentions was to elicit such responses, to create a sense of intense personal empathy.

I noticed that this concept wasn’t unique to Between the World and Me either. Chu and Grande both used first-person narratives to shape empathy and understanding, to really put the reader in the story rather than just tell it. Grande’s vivid description of the feelings that rushed through her young mind when her father returned only to tell her that she would again have to stay behind was authentic and intense. Chu’s casual descriptions of the “gay” experiences she had on the cheerleading bus in high school and the first time she laid eyes on a “hip” femenist in college also did a great job of framing her analysis of radical feminism. Overall, I’m glad I learned how to use text as a vessel in which to experience the lives of others.

const entryEleven = `# Taking Another Look At My Second Entry: Inclusivity Should Not Otherize

> The majority of popular superheroes are white males, which subconsciously breeds the association between whiteness, masculinity, and bravery. Black women are extremely underrepresented in this genre, so it grabs the reader’s attention to see a black, female superhero figure.

In my second commonplace book entry, I broke down the relationship between representation in the superhero genre and race. I took notice of the fact that traditionally, superheroes have always been stereotypically masculine, white men. I made a comment about how the use depicting a woman as a superhero challenges the social expectation that women should not be powerful or stand up to authority.

I feel like I should have delved deeper into the effects of representation in the superhero genre in terms of gender. I’m not exactly super knowledgeable about superhero movies, but am in a social circle that is quite into them. A common complaint I heard around school was that diversity in superhero films felt forced. I recall a friend of mine complaining that every female superhero movie was entirely consumed with themes of female empowerment and overcoming patriarchy. She was a starch feminist, so her viewpoint may at first sound confusing, but she actually made a valid point: if a superhero is a woman, they constantly call attention to the fact that it is a woman and that this is something unusual, rather than simply that the superhero just is a woman?

She felt that constant references to the gender of a superhero reinforced the idea that female power was something abnormal, and made an interesting point: in every superhero movie about a male superhero, they don’t constantly mention their gender. The passive suggestion is that a male superhero is something typical, and that a female superhero is an oddity.

I’m not sure if I fully agree with her viewpoint, but it definitely raises a valid point: why can’t we just have a superhero that is a woman, rather than a woman superhero? Depicting female authority as equally as normal as male authority may help better shape society’s views of gender. I do fear that some may interpret this viewpoint as criticizing the increased representation in the genre. However, she was thrilled about the changes in representation, and her criticism was mainly driven out of fear making powerful women a token in the genre rather than an integral part.
`;

const entryTwelve = `# Black Erasure and Racial Discrimination in Technology

Like most kids from Gen-Z, video games were a huge part of my childhood. When I read Narcisse’s _The Natural_, it mentioned some of my favorite childhood video games, such as the Assassin’s Creed franchise and The Last of Us. These games incorporated black characters, but as Narcisse made mention of, their natural hair was drawn almost lazily.

Back when I was into PC gaming, the rendering of real-life accurate hair was generally considered a difficult technological task, and hardware companies made a point to market technologies such as HairFX that made hair as silky smooth and lifelike as possible. The problem with this hair-rendering craze was that it completely excluded natural hairstyles, focusing largely on straight or wavy hair. It’s saddening to finally pick up on the fact that many of my childhood favorites indirectly committed black erasure.

Furthermore, this shows that black erasure isn’t just an issue of the content of video games, but is built into the medium. It’s important that as society develops technologically that we avoid embedding our biases into new innovations. One can draw a connection between the rendering of hairstyles in video games and other forms of technological racial biases. For example, if one Googles “professional hairstyle”, one will come across images of largely white models with straight hair, while if one Googles “unprofessional hairstyle”, the results are mostly black models with natural hair. I do not take these concerns lightly as a Computer Science major, especially in a time where society is becoming more and more dependent on digital algorithms.
`;

const entryThirteen = `# A Summary of the Concept of Multivocality

Multivocality is a new concept that I’ve been learning about in Kresge. The article Voice/multivocality by Patrice Buzzanell contained a somewhat academic explanation of the phenomenon. I enjoyed how Buzzanell first revisits the concept of voice, remarking how it is used to express both truth and the distortion thereof. Many abstract concepts such as legitimacy, consent, presence, and empowerment are represented through voices, and as such, understanding vocality is crucial to representation.

The complexity of voices comes largely from the fact that they are never singular. Multiple voices can combine, dissent, suppress or otherwise alter an idea in many ways. It is key to remember that for most opinions and consensuses of a group that that conviction is an umbrella over many diverse interpretations of the world and that no association of people is ever truly a monolith.

Furthermore, any truly open discussion space invites diversity of viewpoints. It is not uncommon that one voice can drown out another, and one interpretation can be implicitly accepted as fact when dissenting views are not entertained or included.
`;

const entryFourteen = `# SweetXHeart

When I played _SweetXHeart_, one of the first things I took notice of was the familiar surroundings. I spent a lot of time in the Connecticut-New York Area, and a lot of the exact places and train routes were the exact same as ones I myself had been to. I related to my avatar’s creativity and passion for technology, and I myself even had a job similar to hers. My similarities to the avatar helped me put myself in her shoes a bit easier.

I got unsettled during the part where a random stranger makes comments. I’ve seen incidents like that happen before, and I definitely can say they are not pleasant. The mild overtones of distress and tiredness during rather typical, sometimes even fun days was very effective in communicating the effects of these incidents. I’ve experienced being talked down to and called pet names as well and relate to the indignation that my character felt.

Personally I’m a huge fan of this “slice of life” genre that allows us to think about concepts such as sexual harassment and racial discrimination in the context of an entire life rather than in the context of individual incidents. We all get to see the ways in which these encounters spill into other aspects of the character’s life, such as affecting her sleep or making her late for school.
`;

const entryFifteen = `# Civil Rights Inside and Out

> However, before the man could back away, the corrections officer grabbed him and threw him to the floor. In seconds other guards had him surrounded. They pinned and handcuffed his hands behind his back while his aggressor had a knee pressed into his neck. My fellow prisoner begged them to stop because he couldn’t breathe, only to be told to “shut the fuck up.”

The killing of George Floyd a few months ago was definitely a huge deal for everyone. Amidst a global pandemic and a cutthroat election, America found itself in a huge movement for civil rights and police reform. The video shocked everyone: Floyd was held to the ground and murdered in broad daylight, with three officers passively allowing it. This shocking encounter was followed by brutal suppression of civil rights protests by the police and a Department of Homeland Security occupation in Portland. The public could no longer deny the problems with the institution of policing.

However, people have generally looked the other way when it came to abuse of authority in prisons. Human rights concerns in American prisons have been known for decades, and Moore’s article All Of Us Inside Have Cried Out analyzes what life is like while living under constant threat of arbitrary violence.

Moore recounted a story that was very similar to Floyd’s. On an unclear, minor provocation, an inmate was violently thrown to the ground by a correctional officer and held against the neck. The act was witnessed by around 100 staff and inmates, with no recourse for the guard whatsoever. It makes me think about the fact that once somebody is incarcerated, they’re human rights are considered invalid and no concern is given to abuses of power within prison walls. We need to stop the awful dehumanization of prisoners and start holding correctional officers accountable.
`;

const entrySixteen = `# Thoughts On A Few Finals

With this course coming to an end, it was nice to see what my classmates had worked on. There were many great presentations, some of which were very soulful to me. I loved Alice Wang’s song about mental health, especially as someone who has been very close to mental health issues their whole lives and has a family that suffers from a few different disorders. I also have gotten the chance to work with Alice on my Module 3 project, and it was great to see someone I knew open up. I also enjoyed the presentation made on the fast fashion industry, which caused me to completely rethink the way I purchased clothes. I realized that when I got a cheap price on a garment, the unfortunate reality is that there is a likelihood that someone was exploited to make that price possible. Nowadays, I prefer to purchase clothing made in the United States for some assurance of fair labor conditions.

The most elaborate and stunning project that I can recall was a video game made by two students that was intended to simulate the feeling of ADHD by having the user interact with a fidget cube and try to stay at a certain level of calmness. The effort displayed was amazing, and the concept was brilliant. I can also appreciate their work as a Computer Science student, as it was well drawn and performed well. Overall, I’m excited I’ve gotten to build a sense of community with my fellow Kresgians.
