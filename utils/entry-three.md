# Andrea Long Chu and Inclusive Activism

## The Reality of Social Movements

_On Liking Women_ by Andrea Chu initially engaged me with the author’s account of her adolescence. After divulging her teenage confusion and disappointments, she shifted her focus to radical femenist movements, detailing the history of transphobia within radical femenist movements. Though I’ve always supported femenist causes, I never knew about the complex debate within the movement surrounding transgender legitemacy. Chu makes a point (which is admittedly minor in the context of the story, it just caught my interest) how almost all popular movements, though they tend to inflict positive change, end up being a mixed bag, citing examples such as the Occupy movement. I began to think about the ongoing activism during this election season and wonder: who are we excluding from our activism?

## Feeling Excluded from a Movement

The first thought that came to mind was of my local community and my culture. I hail from the progressively liberal but mostly Jewish community of Calabasas. Specifically, I thought about one of my close friends who, while an avid progressive activist who wasn’t afraid of tear gas, felt that antisemitism was conspicuously absent from the progressive radar. I’ve unfortunately noticed a new trend of Republicans attempting to sway Jewish voters by flinging questionable allegations of antisemitism at Democratic politicians. It is definitely unsettling to see that the only concerns about antisemitism seem to be insincere political ploys used to counter other causes.
Chu explains similar feelings of exclusion. Early radical femenist movements were openly transphobic, and she felt intimidated by the idea that she wasn’t “hip” enough for feminism. After recounting some particularly controversial writings by radical feminists, she laments the unfortunate fact that transgender women still feel their feminimity is in question.
