# SweetXHeart

When I played _SweetXHeart_, one of the first things I took notice of was the familiar surroundings. I spent a lot of time in the Connecticut-New York Area, and a lot of the exact places and train routes were the exact same as ones I myself had been to. I related to my avatar’s creativity and passion for technology, and I myself even had a job similar to hers. My similarities to the avatar helped me put myself in her shoes a bit easier.

I got unsettled during the part where a random stranger makes comments. I’ve seen incidents like that happen before, and I definitely can say they are not pleasant. The mild overtones of distress and tiredness during rather typical, sometimes even fun days was very effective in communicating the effects of these incidents. I’ve experienced being talked down to and called pet names as well and relate to the indignation that my character felt.

Personally I’m a huge fan of this “slice of life” genre that allows us to think about concepts such as sexual harassment and racial discrimination in the context of an entire life rather than in the context of individual incidents. We all get to see the ways in which these encounters spill into other aspects of the character’s life, such as affecting her sleep or making her late for school.
