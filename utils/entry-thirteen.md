# A Summary of the Concept of Multivocality

Multivocality is a new concept that Iâ€™ve been learning about in Kresge. The article Voice/multivocality by Patrice Buzzanell contained a somewhat academic explanation of the phenomenon. I enjoyed how Buzzanell first revisits the concept of voice, remarking how it is used to express both truth and the distortion thereof. Many abstract concepts such as legitimacy, consent, presence, and empowerment are represented through voices, and as such, understanding vocality is crucial to representation.

The complexity of voices comes largely from the fact that they are never singular. Multiple voices can combine, dissent, suppress or otherwise alter an idea in many ways. It is key to remember that for most opinions and consensuses of a group that that conviction is an umbrella over many diverse interpretations of the world and that no association of people is ever truly a monolith.

Furthermore, any truly open discussion space invites diversity of viewpoints. It is not uncommon that one voice can drown out another, and one interpretation can be implicitly accepted as fact when dissenting views are not entertained or included.
