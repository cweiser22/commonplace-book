# Thoughts On A Few Finals

With this course coming to an end, it was nice to see what my classmates had worked on. There were many great presentations, some of which were very soulful to me. I loved Alice Wang’s song about mental health, especially as someone who has been very close to mental health issues their whole lives and has a family that suffers from a few different disorders. I also have gotten the chance to work with Alice on my Module 3 project, and it was great to see someone I knew open up. I also enjoyed the presentation made on the fast fashion industry, which caused me to completely rethink the way I purchased clothes. I realized that when I got a cheap price on a garment, the unfortunate reality is that there is a likelihood that someone was exploited to make that price possible. Nowadays, I prefer to purchase clothing made in the United States for some assurance of fair labor conditions.

The most elaborate and stunning project that I can recall was a video game made by two students that was intended to simulate the feeling of ADHD by having the user interact with a fidget cube and try to stay at a certain level of calmness. The effort displayed was amazing, and the concept was brilliant. I can also appreciate their work as a Computer Science student, as it was well drawn and performed well. Overall, I’m excited I’ve gotten to build a sense of community with my fellow Kresgians.
