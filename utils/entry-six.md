## _Hair Nah_ Wants You To Feel Frustrated, Tired and Creeped Out

Momo Pixel’s Hair Nah is an interesting experience. Your avatar is a black woman with natural hair, and your goal is to travel while still protecting your personal space. A barrage of hands leaps toward your hair, which you must deflect before the time runs out. The controls feel a bit awkward, which is an aspect of the game that feels intentional. The type of high precision, fast mouse movements were incredibly difficult on my laptop trackpad, which was a constant source of frustration throughout the game, an emotion I think Momo Pixel wants me to feel. Women of color have to feel this pressure at all times, and experiencing it for a few minutes is an eye opener. The voice effects added throughout the game play do a good job of making me feel creeped out. A steady flow of “Can I touch your hair?”, “Is it attached to your head?” and other short phrases soon become tiresome and repetitive. This game brought the discomfort to life in a way that is simply amazing.
