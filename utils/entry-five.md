# Glorida Anzaldua: Language as a Part of One's Identity

> Chicano Spanish sprang out of the Chicanos' need to identify ourselves as a distinct people. We needed a language with which we could communicate with ourselves, a secret language. For some of us, language is a homeland closer than the Southwestfor many Chicanos today live in the Midwest and the East.

## Language As An Absolute

As school children, most of us learn about language and grammar in terms of absolute truths, standards from which any deviation was “wrong”. It’s “am not” as opposed to “ain’t”, it’s “grey” not “gray”, that letter is silent, that letter is not silent, you need this here and that over there. Language was not art, not a form of expression or an exercise of individuality, it was more like math, where there was correct and there was incorrect, proper and improper.

## How Speech Conveys Identity

Anzaldua argues that language is not simply a set of standards and absolutes, but a crucial aspect of one’s expression. She opens the text with a jarring, almost violent narrative of a dentist becoming angry as a patient’s tongue interferes with an operation, asserting that something must be done about this tongue’s rebellious nature. The symbolism of this passage implies that stripping someone of their freedom of expression is a form of violence. This opening is intended to make the reader uncomfortable by using an angry dentist to convey the narrative, as many readers may have had terrifying experiences with dentists as a kid. The intensity of the imagery further conveys a horror-movie-like atmosphere.

She follows with an account of childhood experiences in which she was disciplined in school and at home for speaking with a Chicano accent. She was forced to attend a special speech class, the sole purpose of which was to make her accent more Anglo-American. To Anzaldua, language represents an attachment to nationality, a form of connection to her heritage that nobody had the right to take away. As she reflects on these experiences, she points out the inhumanity of censoring an accent, and further divulges the value of language to Chicanos who live in the United States. Overall, the reader begins to question their previous understanding of the concept of language, and how the idea of a “correct” language is arbitrary and wrong.
